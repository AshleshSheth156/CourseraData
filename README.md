 #                                                    Coursera Data Analysis Project

# This project involves the analysis of Coursera dataset using SQL, Tableau, and Python for data manipulation, querying, visualization, and deriving insights.

# Overview

# This repository contains:

#    • SQL Queries: SQL queries used for data exploration, analysis, and extraction from the Coursera dataset.
#    • Tableau Visualizations: Visualizations created in Tableau based on the analyzed dataset.
#    • Python Code: Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


# Contents

#    • /SQL_queries: Contains SQL queries used for various analyses on the dataset.
#    • /Tableau_visualizations: Contains visualizations created in Tableau based on the analyzed dataset.
#    • /Python_scripts: Includes Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization. 

# How to Use
