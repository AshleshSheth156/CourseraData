#                                                         Coursera Data Analysis Project

 This project involves the analysis of Coursera dataset using SQL, Tableau, and Python for data manipulation, querying, visualization, and deriving insights.

 # Overview

 This repository contains:

    • **SQL Queries**: SQL queries used for data exploration, analysis, and extraction from the Coursera dataset.
    • ** Tableau Visualizations**: Visualizations created in Tableau based on the analyzed dataset.
    • **Python Code**: Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


# Contents

   • /**SQL_queries**: Contains SQL queries used for various analyses on the dataset.
   • /**Tableau_visualizations**: Contains visualizations created in Tableau based on the analyzed dataset.
   • /**Python_scripts**: Includes Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization. 

# How to Use

   • **Dataset**: The dataset used for this analysis can be found here. Download and place it in the root directory as coursera_dataset.csv.
   • **SQL Querie**s: Run the provided SQL queries in your preferred database tool (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) using the coursera_dataset.csv file.
   • **Tableau**: Open Tableau and connect to the processed dataset to explore the visualizations.
   • **Python Analysis**: Execute the Python scripts or notebooks in the Python_scripts directory using Jupyter Notebook or your Python environment.

# Requirements

    • Database tool compatible with the provided SQL queries.
    • Tableau software to explore the visualizations.
    • Python 3.x with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed for running Python scripts.
